Our lab at University of Chicago Department of Medicine is looking for undergraduates who are excited to spend the summer getting research experience. Our research sits at the crossroads of computational biology, data science, and epidemiology, and there are a number of possible projects including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Large-scale analysis of health records data to find treatments in health history that change people's outcomes</li>
<li>Analysis of big data profiling how a wide range of cancer cells respond to a wide range of drugs. </li>
<li>Looking at geographic differences in medical practice across the USA (see this recent result: http://drugmap.uchicago.edu/app )</li>
</ul>
<p>But we are open to your ideas!</p>
<p>We are looking for undergraduates with some experience with programming (preferably R or Python), or some classwork in statistics, or both. Students will receive $5000 for 8 weeks (or 10 weeks is also possible). The expectation is that students will spend 40 hours a week and not have any other major commitments during the time of this research experience.</p>
<p>Please apply by filling out <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScOG5yDlxcajKagZIzi9MXiYj7G3HPkwr7s3O_-i5ZA8Ms-Gg/viewform?usp=sf_link">this form</a></p>
<p>Applications will be accepted on a rolling basis until filled. Preference will be given to students with limited research opportunities at their home institutions, underrepresented minorities and women.</p>
